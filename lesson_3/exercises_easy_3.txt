1. Show an easier way to write this array:

  flinstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]
  
  flinstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
  
2. How can we add the famil pet "Dino" to our usual array:

  flinstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
  
  flinstones << "Dino"
  
3. In the previous exercise we added Dino to our array like this:

  flinstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
  flinstones << "Dino"
  
  How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)
  
  flinstones.push("Dino").push("Hoppy")
  flinstones.concat(%w(Dino Hoppy))
  
4. Shorten this sentence:

  advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
  
  remove everything starting from "house"
  
  advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))
  
  As a bonus, what happens when you use the String#slice method instead?
  
  *the "advice" variable stays the same
  
5. Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:

  statement = "The Flinstones Rock!"
  
  statement.scan('t').count
  
6. Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we had a 40 
   character wide table of Flinstone family members, how could we easily center that title above the 
   table with spaces?
   
   title = "Flinstones Family Members"
   
   title.center("10") # centers string with 10 spaces on either side of each string
