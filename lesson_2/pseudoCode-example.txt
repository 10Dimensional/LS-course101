1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

  START
  
    PRINT "What's the first number?"
    SET num1 = GET first number from user input and store in variable
    
    PRINT "What's the second number?"
    SET num2 = GET first number from user input and store in variable
    
    SET result = num1 + num2
    
    PRINT "The total is: " + result
  
  END
  
  
2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

  START
  
    SET array = String of various words
    SET iterator = 0
    
    WHILE iterator < length of array
    
      SET concat_string = Add word to string
      
      iterator = iterator + 1
      
      
    PRINT concat_string
    
  END
  

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

  START
    
    SET array = set of integers
    SET iterator = 0
    SET new_array = []
    
    WHILE iterator < length of array
    
      IF iterator is even
        
        iterator = iterator + 1
      
      ELSE iterator is odd 
      
        Push current integer onto new_array
        
    PRINT new_array
    
  END
