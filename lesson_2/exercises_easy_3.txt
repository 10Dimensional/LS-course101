Question 1 -- Show an easier way to write this array:

flinstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

flinstones = w%(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)


Question 2 -- How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:

flinstones = w%(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

flinstones << "Dino"


Question 3 -- In the previous exercise we added Dino to our array like this:

flinstones = w%(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flinstones << "Dino"

We could have used either Array#concact or Array#push to add Dino to the family.

How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

flinstones.push("Dino").push("Hoppy") # push returns the array so we can chain
flinstones.concact(%W(Dino Hoppy)) # concat adds an array rather than one item


Question 4 -- Shorten this sentence:

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
